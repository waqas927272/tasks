Everything is set up correctly. You can now:

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

If uploads fail:
1. Check PHP `upload_max_filesize` in php.ini
2. Check PHP `post_max_size` in php.ini
3. Ensure `/public/uploads/tasks/` has write permissions
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

If attachments don't show:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Check database for records in `task_attachments` table
3. Verify file paths are correct
