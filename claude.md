Build a complete plug-and-play web application using:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (modern responsive UI for all devices).
Backend: PHP (custom MVC structure, NOT Laravel).
Database: MySQL with migration and seeding.
Environment file: .env for configuration.

Features to Implement
âœ… User Roles & Permissions

Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Task history (status & date changes logged).

âœ… Notifications

Automatic notifications for:

Task created

Status changed

âœ… Setup & Deployment

setup.php should handle:

DB connection check

Running migrations

Running seeders

App must run seamlessly on localhost AND live hosting without editing URLs.

âœ… Frontend UI

Clean, modern, responsive dashboard for all users.

Navigation for switching between views (Admin, CSM, Client).

âœ… Technical Requirements

Use .env for DB settings.

Use .htaccess for clean URLs (no index.php?controller=task).

MVC structure must be clear and maintainable.

ðŸš€ Deliverables
Full MVC PHP project.

SQL migrations and seeders.

setup.php script.

.env.example file.

Clean and responsive frontend design.
